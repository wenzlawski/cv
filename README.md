# CV of Marc Wenzlawski
This repository contains my CV. The makefile compiles PDF and (soon) HTML variants to be displayed on my website. 

To compile, make sure you have [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org) and `latex` (through e.g. [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) or [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)) and run `just all`.

## Roadmap
 - HTML CV
 - modular composition of CV

## License
All code is distributed under the MIT license. The content of the CV is property of Marc Wenzlawski. Feel free to fork and redesign the template as you like, just include your own merits :--).
